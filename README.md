# The MixologistV2

The MixologistV2 is a cocktail recipe app made with Vue.js that I developed to help users make delicious drinks at home. The app features a wide variety of cocktail recipes with detailed instructions and video demonstrations, making it easy for users to follow along and make the perfect drink. The app allows users to search for recipes by ingredients, type, or name. 

This project was a great opportunity for me to apply my skills in front-end development, using technologies such as Vue.js, and to work on a project from start to finish. It was a challenging but exciting experience, and I am proud to have developed a functional and user-friendly app that helps users make delicious cocktails at home.
